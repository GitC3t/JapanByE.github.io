            <h1>The History of Japan</h1>
            <h4>Pre-Ceramic Cultrue</h4>

            <p>
              Japan is not known when human first settlend on the Japanese archipelago. For a long time, it was belived that there was no Paleolithic occupation in Japan, but ever since World War II,
              thousand of sites that have been unearted throughout Japan, yeilding a wide varity of Paleolithic tools. This includes both core tools, that are made by chipping away the surface of the stone,
              and flake tools, made by working with a stone flake broken off from a larger peice of stone. There is not much doubt that the people who used these moved to Japan from Asia. At one time, land
              connection, which are know Korea and Tsushima straits, that made  immmigration for the Korean peninsula possible. Another connection, which are now Sōya and Tsugaru straits, allowed people to
              go in from the northeastern part of Asia. The Pre-Ceramic culture, by the way, is followed by two more better recorded cultures, which are the Jōmon and Yayoi. The fromer takes its name from a type of pottery that is found
              throughout Japan; its discoverer being the 19th-century American zoologist Edward S. Morse. He called the pottery <i>jōmon</i>, or <i>cord marks</i> in English, to describe the
              patterns pressed and embedded into the clay. A highly-convincing theory dates the period during which the pottery was used from about 10,500 until about the 3rd century BCE.
              Just for clarifiction, though, this history is history that dates <strong>way</strong> back. For more recent facts, check out the <a href="facts.html">facts page</a>
